## Building the App: 
The app was developed under [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). Android Studio has a great code editor interface as well as GUI layout that makes designing the windows and style of the app very easy. Android studio also has a built in compiler and android debug bridge that allows it to build and install the app right to an android phone. It makes debugging apps very nice as well. 

To get started:
* Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* Download this repository using `git clone` or clicking 'download zip' on the main web page. 
* Open Android Studio, setting up first time preferences as desired
* If a window pops up asking to open an android project or create a new one, click 'open an existing android project'
  * If a window does not pop up, click on the folder icon in in the top left corner. 
* Navigate to the download of this repository and select 'app_development' with the green icon. Click open.

Once the project is opened, Android studio will automatically verify all of the files. From here, you can edit code, build new versions of the app, and deploy them to an android phone connected over [adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb).
